# Java Virtual Threads using Spring Boot and Web MVC


## Josh's Addendum

99.9% of this is code I stole shamelessly from my amazing colleague [Cora Iberkleid](https://github.com/ciberkleid/springone2023-virtual-threads-demo)

## The Demo So Far... 

This project showcases Spring Boot 3.2 support for Java virtual threads in Web MVC applications.
This demo uses Tomcat web server, but the same support is available for Jetty as well.

This application makes a blocking call to an endpoint that adds a delay before responding.

> Bonus: The demo also showcases two other features new in Spring Boot 3.2:
> [RestClient](com/example/demo/DemoController.java) and 
> [TestContainers for dev](com/example/demo/TestDemoApplication.java).

### Pre-requisites

1. Docker - for running the backend application
2. Java 21 - for virtual thread support in the JVM
3. `hey` CLI, or an alternative load test utility

### Instructions

Run the demo three times, using the three configuration options below.
You will observe improved performance and hardware utilization using virtual threads as compared to using platform threads in an imperative code base.

##### Test 1: Use traditional platform threads
- Open the file [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties).
- Make sure `spring.threads.virtual.enabled` is commented out or set to `false`.
- Set `server.tomcat.threads.max` to the number of cores on your machine.

##### Test 2: Use virtual threads
- Open the file [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties).
- You can ignore or comment out `server.tomcat.threads.max`.
- Set `spring.threads.virtual.enabled=true`.
- Open the file [TestDemoApplication.java](com/example/demo/TestDemoApplication.java).
- Set `jdk.virtualThreadScheduler.maxPoolSize` to the number of cores on your machine.

##### Test 3: Use virtual threads with less hardware
- Use the settings from Test 2 above.
- Set `jdk.virtualThreadScheduler.maxPoolSize` to `1`.

### Start demo app

The following command will launch both the backend and the demo application.
> Note: The backend app is started by Testcontainers as a docker container.
> This requires using a test goal to start the application, as shown in the command below.
```shell
./mvnw clean spring-boot:test-run
```

### Run a load test

Try a number of requests with delays (see options for `hey` to configure load test).
For example, simulate 20 clients sending a total of 60 requests, with a 3-second delay from the backend:
```shell
hey  -c 20 -n 60 http://localhost:8080/block/3
```

The logs should show if you are using platform threads (e.g. `Thread[#19,http-nio-8080-exec-1,5,main]`)
or virtual threads (e.g. `VirtualThread[#36,tomcat-handler-0]/runnable@ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1`).

In either case, the `exec` or `worker` thread number should not exceed the limits you set in the configuration (i.e. the number of cores on your machine, or `1` in Test 3).

Compare the output of the load test.
You should observe that performance is significantly better with virtual threads, even if the application is provided less hardware.
